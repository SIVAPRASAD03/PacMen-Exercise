# PacMen-Exercise

This repo has the PacMen Exercise Code. The objective is to build a feature to the Pacmen game, which displays and moves PacMan from one side of the screen to the other. 

Folders and files:

    images folder: This folder contains the images representing Pac-Man at different stages (mouth open, mouth closed).
    index.html: This is the HTML file that displays the PacMan.
    pacman.js: This contains the PacMan animation JavaScript code.
